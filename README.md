# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json`

Launches a JSON server using `npx`, a package runner tool. The server runs on port 3500 (-p `3500`) and watches for changes in the specified JSON file (`data/db.json`) to provide a RESTful API. This is useful for creating a mock server for development purposes, allowing developers to simulate a backend with sample data and test API interactions without connecting to a real server
